# Car Wiping System
A wiper is a device that is used to clean raindrops or any other type of water from the windshield. Wipers are designed and manufactured to remove water from a windshield. Most cars have two wipers on the windshield, one on the back window, and one on each front light. The elastic edge, the wiper arm supporting the sharp edge, a spring linkage, and segments of the wiper turns are visible from outside the vehicle. The real wiper contains around six pressure focuses or paws, which are little arms beneath the wiper. 
There were two developments looked on in this assignment as the literature review. The two were planned with different ideas and functional components, but with the same purpose of maintaining the vehicle wiper's working quality. The downpour sensor was a very flexible gadget for programming the cleaning of a vehicle's windscreen when it became wet due to moisture, rains, or even mud. It worked by reflecting friendly light pillars within the windshield. When rains fall on the windshield, this amicability light is disturbed, causing the light bar force to decrease. The framework then instructed the wipers to operate in full programmed mode. It creates 0.1-second reaction memories.It was considered a quick response when an abrupt sprinkling of water caused the motorist to go completely 'blind' when the event occurred. The driver can reduce the risk of an accident by using the scheduled wiper. The programmable wiper is useful in heavy traffic areas such as the city, school zone, and other public areas. A driver may face repeated interruptions due to bad weather, hazardous road conditions, and fatigue. The Rain Sensor lightened the driver's load by making driving more pleasant. Following a wet vehicle is no longer a bother, as even 0.005 millilitres of water can be found.

# Component Used:
## 1. STM32F407 
The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm Cortex -M4 32-bit RISC processor, which operates at up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core includes a single-precision floating point unit (FPU) that supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data formats. It also has a complete set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) to improve programme security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families have high-speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 1 Mbyte, SRAM up to 192 Kbytes), backup SRAM up to 4 Kbytes, and a wide range of upgraded I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses, three AHB buses, and a 32-bit multi-AHB bus matrix.

# ADVANTAGES:
* Rain sensors collect water during rain events and store it for use during the summer and winter.
* It is quite simple to use.
* As a result, rain sensor-based equipment such as vehicle wipers and irrigation systems survive longer because they only operate when needed.
* Rain sensor-based systems are extremely simple to install.

# DISADVANTAGES:
* To avoid erroneous rain detection, rain sensors must make a decision within a few minutes.
* When water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW):

# WHAT:
* A wiper speed control instrument limits the functioning speed of a car wiper in response to rainfall circumstances. The control framework combines a rainfall sensor (30) that detects downpour conditions to create. The sufficiency of a basic sign is dependent on the identified rain conditions.

# WHY:
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
* The screen wipers clear the windshield of rain and snow, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO:
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.

# HOW:
* The sped of the wiper system can be changed according to the requirement.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
# STRENGTH:
* Good Reputation
* Big Influence on the Market
* High Bargaining Power Supliers
* Low Budget

# WEAKNESS:

* High Transaction Cost
* Structural Inertia
* No Focus on Private Sector

# OPPRONUTIES:

* Technological Development
* Demands in Automobile  Equipments
* Emerging New Markets

# THREATS:

* Ethical Pressure
* Low Bargaining Power Buyers
* Econimical Crisis
