# Car WIping System
The wiper is a basic component that clears rainfall or other water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and manufactured to remove water from a vehicle's windshield. The majority of automobiles have two wipers on the windshield, one on the back glass, and one on each front light. The elastic edge, the wiper arm supporting the sharp edge, a spring linkage, and segments of the wiper turns are the wiper parts visible from the outside of the vehicle. Under the wiper, there are roughly six pressure focuses or paws, which are small arms.The structure uses the control tail to start the wiper, and the most common method of bringing it up is tough. The driver's concentration will be harmed by having to turn on and off the control tail. As a result, this framework is recommended to address such a wide range of challenges. This wiper framework is similar to other conventional wipers in concept, however it will be upgraded to a programmed control system by using a controller. Water activates the wiper engine when it comes into contact with a dedicated sensor on the windscreen. If the wiper isn't detected by the sensor, it will stop. This will help the driver focus more and reduce the chances of an auto collision.
